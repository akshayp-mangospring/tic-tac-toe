Non Logged In mode:
User visits the page and can start playing the game in v/s Computer mode.
The first game that's offered to him would be in easy mode.
The difficulty level would gradually increase over multiple games.
The final version of the game to be delivered would be Minimax version.
Once he's played the game for 5th time.
Show the user a popup saying that he should consider playing online with real people.
If he declines then he can continue playing.
This mode of the game should also be supported offline. Meaning a basic PWA.
The user can switch the mode of play from v/s Computer to two players dynamically on the fly.

Logged in mode:
Once the user logs in, he'll be visiting his room's url, then he can send the link to any of his friends.
Each user would have exactly one room created for himself, at the time of user creation itself.
Only one other user apart from the user can enter the room. Once another user enters the room is locked from any other entries.
Then the players can start playing online.
If the user chooses to switch his mode of play from online to offline players or v/s Computer he'd be able to do so. But he'd be left from his room.
Even after login if the user is playing in offline mode he won't be logged out, but would be told after a few(5-10) games to consider playing online.
Offline playing mode should mimic the non logged in version of the game.
